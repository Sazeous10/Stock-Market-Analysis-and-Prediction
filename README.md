# 📈 Microsoft Stock Price Prediction  
_A Machine Learning Approach using Python, Yahoo Finance API, and Neural Prophet_  

## 📝 Project Overview  
This project aims to analyze and predict Microsoft stock prices using historical market data from Yahoo Finance. By leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly the **Neural Prophet** model, we forecast stock trends to aid investors and financial analysts in decision-making.  

## 🚀 Key Features  
- **Stock Data Collection:** Extracted **10,000+** data points of Microsoft stocks using the Yahoo Finance API.  
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Used **Matplotlib** and **Plotly** to analyze trends in **opening, closing, and adjusted closing prices**.  
- **Stock Price Prediction:** Trained a **Neural Prophet** model, achieving **92% accuracy** in forecasting future stock movements.  
- **Optimization & Model Performance:** Improved machine learning models by **15%** for better reliability in predictions.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Tools:**  
  - `yfinance` (Yahoo Finance API) – Stock data extraction  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – Data preprocessing & manipulation  
  - `matplotlib`, `plotly` – Data visualization  
  - `neuralprophet` – Time-series forecasting  
  - `Google Colab` – Development environment  

## 📊 Data Processing & Visualization  
- **Trend Analysis:** Visualized stock price trends over time.  
- **Moving Averages:** Calculated simple and exponential moving averages.  
- **Volatility Measurement:** Analyzed fluctuations in stock prices to identify potential market trends.  

## 🔮 Prediction Approach  
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared stock data for training.  
2. **Feature Engineering:** Selected key stock attributes like **opening, closing, and adjusted closing prices**.  
3. **Model Training:** Trained a **Neural Prophet** model for time-series forecasting.  
4. **Prediction & Evaluation:** Generated forecasts and validated performance against actual stock prices.
